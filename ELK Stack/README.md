# Definition
* Elasticsearch = Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine
* Logstash = Logstash is a server‑side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch
* Kibana = Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch
* Grafana = Data visualation tool


# To Read
* Elasticsearch = NoSQL Distributed Database / Search Engine / Analytics Engine / Analytics Tool written in Java 
* Elasticsearch is used to store and analyze the logs generated by the application.   
* By default , Kibana connects to Elasticsearch on localhost. 
* Logstash collects logs from different sources ( SysLogs, Log files , Kafka Queues … etc ) and stores logs in Elasticsearch then Kibana makes a query to elastic search to view logs in UI 

# Terminology
* Elasticsearch = Log Analysis Tool
* Logstash = Data Pipeline Tool to Elasticsearch
* Kibana = Data Visualization Tool
* Beats = 
* Stash = Store

# Need for log analysis: 
* Issue debugging 
* Security analysis 
* Predictive analysis 
* Performance analysis 
* IOT & debugging 

# Problems with log analysis: 
* Non consistent log format 
* Non consistent time format 
* Decentralized logs 
* Expert knowledge requirement 

# Log management Tools: 
1. Splunk 
2. graylog 
3. Loogly 
4. logentries 
5. sumologic 



# Elasticsearch

* Open source tool for log analysis 
* It is Apache Lucene based search engine 
* Stores Logs in the JSON format indexing it & will search the logs & will analyze the logs using index 
* localhost:9200 
* Elasticsearch 5.6.5 stable version

# Logstash

* It is data pipeline tool. 
* Open source tool for log analysis 
* It is a data pipeline to elastic search 
* It collects and monitor logs from remote machine 
* Collects Logs , Sends Logs to Elastic search through data pipeline 
* Logstash 5.6.5 stable version
     * It will centralize the data processing. 
     * It will collect , parse & analyze the structured / unstructured data & events. 
     * It provides plugin to connect to various types of input sources & platforms.

# Kibana

* Open source tool for log analysis 
* Data exploration & data visualization tool 
* Kibana is the UI or frontend to search data in elastic search . It’s a web based tool.  
* Shows Logs
     * It searches data in elasticsearch 
     * It performs analytics and creates reports 
     * It creates dynamic  dashboards that get updated in real time 
     * It provides the real time analysis
* localhost:5601 
* Kibana 5.6.5 stable version
* Create index pattern in Kibana
     * Discover 
     * Index pattern 
     * Available fields 
     * Selected fields 
     * Filter 
* Visualization ( Pie chart , Bar chart … etc )
* Dashboard = Visualization + Saved Search ( Filter )
