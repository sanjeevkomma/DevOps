# Definition
* Docker = Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production
* Kubernetes = Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available

# Installation
* [Install Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)


# Kubernetes (K8s) : To Read
* Kubernetes is cloud neutral, it can be run / installed on AWS / AZure / GCP 
* Kubernetes leverages the simplicity of Platform as a Service (PaaS) when used on the Cloud
* A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node
* Kubernetes is for Container Orchestration
* Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes
* A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers
* Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications
* GCP provides managed service called GKE to create & manage Kubernetes cluster
* Google uses GKE to run YouTube , Google Maps, Google Search
* AWS calls Vitual Server as EC2 instance in AWS Cloud
* AZure calls Virtual Servers as Virtual Machines in AZure cloud
* GCP calls Virtual Servers as Compute Cloud in GCP
* Kubernetes calls Virtual Servers as Nods in Kubernetes cluster
* We can NOT have container with out POD in Kubernetes. The container lives inside the POD
* A POD can have multiple Containers. The Containers inside the POD share resources and Containers inside the POD can talk to each other using localhost / same host.
* Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is created by clients and scheduled onto hosts
* Each Node can have mulitple Pods, and each Pod can have multiple Containers
* A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster
* Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications
* ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time
* Container runs inside the Pod
* Pod provides grouping for Containers
* As soon as we deploy app / image into Kubernetes, it creates new Replica Set
* Kubernetes uses deployment strategy called "Rolling updates" to make sure Zero downtime deployments 
* The rolling update strategy is a gradual process that allows you to update your Kubernetes system with only a minor effect on performance and no downtime
* Rolling update strategy means that It updates one Pod ( Pod instance ) at a time. It launches new Pod for V2 version, then it reduces no of Pods for V1 version and then increases no of Pods for V2 version and so on
* In Kubernetes, instance means Pod instance
* Deployment ensures that release upgrade switch from V1 to V2 happens with out a hitch. We dont need to have downtime when we release new version of application
* Each POD has its own IP Address
* Load will be distributed among all the PODs using load balancer
* In Kubernetes, service provides external interface to applications which are running inside Pods
* POD is wrapper for set of Containers. Each POD has its own IP Address, Label, Annotation etc
* In practice, Replica Set is always tied with a specific release version ( V1 version, V2 version etc )
* In kubernetes world , Pod is a throw away unit. It can be deleted / created ...
* Service will be created with an unique IP Address ( LoadBalancer IP Address ), when we expose the deployment to Kubernetes
* Loadbalancer will distribute the load among the Pods in Kubernetes
* Each Cluster has its own unique IP Address 
* Each Service / Load Balancer has its own unique IP Address & Port number
* Each Pod has its own IP Address
* Protocol can be "TCP"
* The role of service is providing always available external interface to the applications which are running inside the pods
* Service allows the applications to receive traffic through permanant IP Address
* Service remains up & running. It provides constant frontend interface irrespective of what ever changes happening in the background which are all the pods where application is running
* Kubernetes provides excellent integration with all cloud providers specific loadbalancers
* Loadbalancer is type of Service provided by all cloud provides such as GCP, AWS, AZure
* Service will be load balancing between Pods running at that time
* Each cluster has its own IP Address
* External Load balancer will be created automatically by Kubernetes for each Service when service gets created
* Kubernetes is integrated with GCP to create / provide load balancer
* Loadbalancer itself is a service provided by Cloud Provider
* ClusterIP service is the service which can be accessed inside the Cluster
* "Workloads" is specific to Service in GCP
* etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines
* Each Worker Node can have any number of PODs
* etcd is a CNCF project, which used by Kubernetes, ROOK, CoreDNS, M3
* Master Node does NOT run any application related Containers
* Kubernetes can run any Containers, specific to OCI ( Open Container Interface ), not only Docker
* Environment variable ( for ex : SERVICE_NAME_SERVICE_HOST ) for each Service ( for ex : SERVICE_NAME ) will be created by Kubernetes automatically when we launch up new POD
* When we launch up new POD, all the existing service information is made available to Pod as Environment variable
* Every micro-service is treated as "Service" in Kubernetes Cluster
* YAML file is the example of Declarative Way
* Environment Variable helps Micro services communication
* Each micro-service has its own Environment Variable, which helps for Micro services communication
* Config Map is that where we have Centralized Configuration

# Features
* Auto Scaling --- can scale up / down the containers
* Service Discovery --- It helps microservice to find another microservice using Environment Variable ( default Environment Variable / custom Environment Variable )
* Load Balancer --- distribute load among containers ( instances of micro service )
* Self Healing ---
* Zero downtime deployments --- release new version without downtime
* Centralized Configuration = Config Map
* Centralized Logging
* Centralized Monitoring

# Services
1. LoadBalancer
2. ClusterIP
3. NodePort

# Components of Master Node
1. [etcd](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/) = etcd is distributed database
2. API Server ( kube-api server ) = Kubectl talks to Kubernetes Cluster. Google Clould Console talks to Kubernetes Cluster. 
3. Scheduler ( kube-scheduler )= It will schdule the Pods onto Nodes
4. Controller Manager ( kube-controller-manager ) = It manages health of Cluster and make sure actual state of Cluster matches with desired state of Cluster

# Components of Worker Node
1. Node Agent ( kubelet ) = It communicates with Master Node
2. Networking Component ( kube-proxy ) = It helps to expose the deployement as service into Node 
3. Container Runtime ( CRI - for ex : Docker ) = It helps to run Container inside Pod
4. PODs ( Multiple Pods running containers )
